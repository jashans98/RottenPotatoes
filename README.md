# Rotten Potatoes
#### My first Ruby on Rails application, built from the ground up

Rotten Potatoes is an application I developed in order to learn more about engineering
Software as a Service (SaaS) applications using Ruby on Rails. So far, by following the tutorials
and guidelines highlighted by the [course book](http://www.saasbook.info/)
for Berkeley's [CS169x online course](https://www.edx.org/course/agile-development-using-ruby-rails-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x), 
 I have learned:

* What it means to design a RESTful application
* How to organize the application according to MVC
* Databases and migrations using Rake
* Simple CRUD using ActiveRecord
* Basic templating using Haml
